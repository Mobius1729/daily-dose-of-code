# daily-dose-of-code

A WebScraper made with Python that ustilises Reddit's API and the Reddit API wrapper PRAW in order to scrape Reddit.

I made a program which scrapes r/DailyProgrammer, allowing the user of this program to easily access the hottest programming challanges posted to the sub.
This is program produces a CSV file containing all the scraped data, as well as a JSON file for those interested in the barebones.

You will find a variety of challanges, as well as the information in regards to the post and a URL linking to the original post.

Enjoy and happy coding!
